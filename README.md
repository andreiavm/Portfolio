# Portfolio

My first UX design portfolio built in the context of one of my university courses. 
The projects got removed from the "work" section because they lost relevancy.
Currently I am working on building a new version of my portfolio using React, but I am keeping this one as a memory of my first web dev project.
Built using plain HTML and CSS.
Animations made using the GSAP Library.
