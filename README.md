# Portfolio

My first UX design portfolio, which was built in the context of one of my university courses.  /br
The projects got removed from the "work" section because they lost relevancy. /br
Currently, I am working on building a new version of my portfolio using React, but I am keeping this one as a memory of my first web dev project. /br
Built using plain HTML and CSS. /br
Animations made using the GSAP Library.
