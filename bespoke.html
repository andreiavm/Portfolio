                      <h2>the problem:</h2>
                      <p>For this project we had to translate the 'old' rituals of giving and receiving gifts to the digital context, so the giving of intangible gifts becomes as meaningful as getting regular tangible gifts. The gift giving experience consists of four elements that work together to tell a consistent and coherent story that helps strengthen the memory of the gift: announcement, unwrapping, reveal and resolution.</p>

                      <p>In order to craft an experience that is bespoke for our user, first we had to perform user research. We converged and ideated our research questions, and then we diverged and started performing different methods of ethnographic research.</p>

                    <p>Sequently to performing four different methods of ethnographic research and collecting all the data, we converged again and created an affinity diagram that groups all the data into clusters, from which I extracted the user insights. The image is blurred because I didn't get the permision from my user to use his private information in the public domain.</p>

                        <p>We built a paper prototype and tested the core features of our application. We used this "cheap" method of prototyping in order to conserve resources and make mistakes that are easy to correct, during the incipient stage of our prototyping. </p>
                        <p>We converged again and performed two rounds of testing on two different iterations of the lo-fi prototypes, where we identified usability problems with our designed experience. </p>

                          <p>As a final step in the design thinking process, we tested our high fidelity prototypes with multiple users, but also with Marcus for whom we were building this experience. </p>
                          <p>The results were surprising, and after testing the hi-fi prototype we decided to tweak a few of the aesthetic choices, because the user felt like these don't really work for him. More importantly, we changed the flow of the application for the reveal moment, because the testing proved that it wasn't as surprising as we first thought.</p>
                          <p>By changing the flow and a few of the main components of the application, we improved both the usability and the interactivity, thus making it more engaging and stimulating for our user. </p>

The user opens all the boxes in sequencial order, and with each box he recieves a question that is related to his personality and interests. </p><p>As the unwrapping takes place, each question reveals the surprise little by little, and in the end the reveal moment happens and the user gets his intangible gift, which was a plane ticket to Italy.</p><p>After the reveal moment, the resolution gives the user the option to come back to the app and upload a picture from the holiday, thus wrapping up the whole experience nicely with an end goal.</p>

                        <p>While working on this project, I have learned how to apply the design thinking process and how to iterate through the different stages of it, by converging and diverging.</p><p>I got a grasp on what it takes to work in a fast paced environment, as this whole project was executed in weekly sprints, and I understood the importance of research for design.</p><p>Finally, I understood how important soft skills are when working in a multicultural team of designers, and how to adapt to the diffrent styles of communication each person on the team has. </p>
